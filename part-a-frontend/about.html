                            Our group consists of a 0.1x engineer, and a horrible penetration tester. Our team is passionate about spreading misinformation and helping others succeed to doing their worst possible. We've collectively spent thousands of hours perfecting our craft of inefficiency and have proudly never met a deadline. With expertise ranging from copy-pasting Stack Overflow answers to breaking production on Fridays, we're here to guide you down the path of glorious mediocrity.

                        <p class="card-text">This website may be on the brink of crashing, but its at least fun to watch it work. The HTML, CSS and JavaScript used are all carefully written to be disguisting by using the worst possible coding practices in existence. Instead of wanting to make it look and function properly, we were more concerned about making it funny. But that is the joy of it.</p>
